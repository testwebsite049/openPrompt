# Like & Share Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive like and share functionality for the openPrompt application, covering both frontend and backend components.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Database Models

#### Updated Prompt Model (`backend/models/Prompt.js`)
- Added `shares` field to track share count
- Added `likedBy` array to track users who liked the prompt
- Added `sharedBy` array to track users who shared the prompt

#### New UserActivity Model (`backend/models/UserActivity.js`)
- Created comprehensive user activity tracking for anonymous users
- Tracks likes, shares, and views per session
- Uses session-based tracking with IP and User-Agent
- Automatic cleanup after 30 days via TTL index
- Methods for checking user interactions

### 2. Enhanced API Endpoints

#### Updated Prompt Controller (`backend/controllers/promptController.js`)
- **Enhanced `toggleLike`**: Now supports both like and unlike with proper user tracking
- **New `getLikeStatus`**: Check if user has liked a prompt
- **New `sharePrompt`**: Track shares and generate platform-specific URLs
- **Session Management**: Helper functions for anonymous user tracking

#### Updated Routes (`backend/routes/promptRoutes.js`)
- `GET /api/prompts/:id/like-status` - Check like status
- `POST /api/prompts/:id/like` - Toggle like/unlike
- `POST /api/prompts/:id/share` - Share prompt with tracking

### 3. Share URL Generation
Automatic generation of platform-specific sharing URLs:
- Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn
- WhatsApp, Telegram, Email
- Copy link and copy full prompt functionality

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Enhanced usePrompts Hook (`src/hooks/usePrompts.ts`)
- **Session Management**: Automatic session ID generation and storage
- **Like Functionality**: Toggle likes with real-time state updates
- **Share Functionality**: Multiple share types with tracking
- **State Management**: Track user likes and shares locally
- **Helper Functions**: `hasUserLiked`, `hasUserShared`, `getLikeStatus`

### 2. New ShareModal Component (`src/components/ShareModal.tsx`)
- **Professional UI**: Clean, responsive modal design
- **Multiple Share Options**: Social media, email, copy functionality
- **Real-time Feedback**: Copy confirmations and loading states
- **Platform Detection**: Native share API when available
- **Prompt Preview**: Shows prompt details in modal

### 3. Enhanced PromptImageCard (`src/components/PromptImageCard.tsx`)
- **Interactive Like Button**: Visual feedback for liked state
- **Share Integration**: Opens share modal on click
- **Real-time Updates**: Shows current like and share counts
- **State Persistence**: Maintains user interaction state
- **Visual Indicators**: Different styles for liked/shared states

## Key Features

- IP and User-Agent based session identification

### Real-time State Management
- Immediate UI updates on interactions
- Optimistic updates with error handling
- Local storage persistence for user preferences

### Comprehensive Sharing
- **Social Platforms**: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn
- **Messaging Apps**: WhatsApp, Telegram
- **Direct Sharing**: Email, copy link, copy full prompt
- **Analytics**: Track share counts and share types

### Professional UI/UX
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design for all devices
- Accessible button states and feedback

## Usage Instructions
